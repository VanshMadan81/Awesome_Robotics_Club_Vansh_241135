This project fascinates me because it brings together the challenge of autonomy with real-time decision-making. The idea of a robot exploring unknown place and the path planing objective which we will learn during the amazes me that how a robot will have a training that it is capable of Learn to plan paths, avoid obstacles, and send goal commands for fully autonomous movement.Also thrilled of its Robot Localization objective.
Overall i liked the concept of the project and want to give my 100% to make this project succed.
